      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        Also known as the "The Blue City", "Sun City" and "Gateway to Thar",
        Jodhpur is famous for its Mehrangarh fort, blue houses, temples, sweets
        and snacks. Apart from the fort, there are multiple temples, lakes,
        shopping streets that are like a mirage from a bygone era. The former
        capital of Marwar, Jodhpur is one of the most enchanting cities of
        Rajasthan, with its mighty Mehrangarh fort overlooking the city. The
        city is called the Blue City as it looks completely blue in colour from
        an aerial view because of its blue walls and blue houses. Nearby Jaswant
        Tada and Umaid Bhawan Palace are also among the top attractions in
        Jodhpur. However, the magic lies in the old city itself with hundreds of
        shops, guesthouses, eating joints and vendors make it a chirpy bustling
        city, especially near the landmark clock tower and Sardar Market. Seen
        in the backdrop of the movie, The Dark Knight Rises, Jodhpur attracts
        hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world. Jodhpur is
        conveniently located in the centre of Rajasthan making it easier for
        people visiting Jodhpur to explore other destinations of the state.
