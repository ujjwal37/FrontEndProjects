      <p>
        Pushkar is one of the oldest cities in India. Located to the northwest
        of Ajmer, the tranquil city of Pushkar is a favoured destination for
        thousands of tourists and devotees flocking to Rajasthan. Situated at a
        height of 510 metres, Pushkar is surrounded by hillocks on three sides.
        The ‘Nag Pahar’, literally meaning Snake Mountain forms a natural border
        between Ajmer and Pushkar. Known as ‘the rose garden of Rajasthan’, the
        essence of the famous Pushkar rose is exported all over the world. Along
        with an interesting mythological history, a legacy of timeless
        architectural heritage makes Pushkar a fascinating city. According to
        legends, Lord Brahma, believed to be the creator of the Universe dropped
        a lotus to the ground leading to the immediate creation of a lake. He
        then decided to name the place after the flower, and thus the name,
        Pushkar. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple dedicated to
        Lord Brahma in the whole world. Hindus consider a journey to Pushkar to
        be the ultimate pilgrimage that must be undertaken to attain salvation.
