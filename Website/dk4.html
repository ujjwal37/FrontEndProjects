      <p>
        Jaisalmer is a major tourist spot located in the northwestern state of
        Rajasthan in India. It is known as the 'golden city' due to its
        bounteous golden dunes and castles clad in golden honey sandstone.
        Jaisalmer is adorned with lakes, ornate Jain temples and havelis. Climb
        on to the camel saddle and make your way through this desert or camp
        under the night sky in this golden land for an unforgettable experience.
        The Jaisalmer Fort stands as a citadel and is surrounded by narrow
        alleys inhabited by people residing there for generations. With shops
        selling colourful handicrafts and havelis that will make you travel back
        in time, Jaisalmer is an amalgam of exotic Indian desert culture,
        heritage and adventure.
