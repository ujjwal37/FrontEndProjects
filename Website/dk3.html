      <p>
        Jaipur is a vibrant amalgamation of the old and the new. Also called the
        Pink City, The capital of the royal state of Rajasthan, Jaipur has been
        ruled by Rajput kingdoms for many centuries and developed as a planned
        city in the 17th century AD. Along with Delhi and Agra, Jaipur forms the
        Golden Triangle, one of the most famous tourist circuits of the country.
        With the old city surrounded by walls and gates decorated with drawings
        on the backdrop of a beautiful pink hue, Jaipur, the pink city
        successfully manages to retain its old world charm. Home to a few UNESCO
        World Heritage sites including Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar, Jaipur is
        home to many magnificent forts, palaces, temples and museums. Jaipur is
        filled to the brim with bustling local bazaars where you can shop for
        local handicrafts and trinkets to your heart's content. Popular bazaars
        in the city include Bapu Bazaar, Tripolia Bazaar and Johri Bazaar.
        Jaipur is also very well known for its local food and the most famous
        dishes include the Ghewar, Pyaaz Kachori and Dal Baati Churma. One of
        the largest cities in India, Jaipur is also home to all the modern
        amenities with some of the most exotic hotels and resorts in the world.
        The city boasts an international airport and is also very well connected
        by rail and road. The metro, local buses, shared tuk-tuks,
        auto-rickshaws and taxi aggregator apps including Uber and Ola solve the
        commute problem in the city quite comfortably. It's quite interesting to
        see the highly urbanised pockets and shopping areas have casually sprung
        up beside gleaming forts and palaces. Majestic buildings, tales of
        heroic battles, resplendent forts and palaces, and multi-faceted
        characters, Jaipur has long been one of the shiniest cultural jewels in
        the history of the Indian subcontinent. With friendly people known for
        their hospitality, Jaipur offers a plethora of options for travellers.
